✨ Your new, shiny [Nx workspace](https://nx.dev) is almost ready ✨.

[Learn more about this workspace setup and its capabilities](https://nx.dev/nx-api/js?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) or run `npx nx graph` to visually explore what was created. Now, let's get you up to speed!

## Finish your CI setup

## Generate a library

```sh
npx nx g @nx/js:lib packages/pkg1 --publishable --importPath=@my-org/pkg1
```

## Run tasks

To build the library use:

```sh
npx nx build pkg1
```

To run any task with Nx use:

```sh
npx nx <target> <project-name>
```

These targets are either [inferred automatically](https://nx.dev/concepts/inferred-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) or defined in the `project.json` or `package.json` files.

[More about running tasks in the docs &raquo;](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)

## Versioning and releasing

To version and release the library use

```
npx nx release
```

Pass `--dry-run` to see what would happen without actually releasing the library.

## Keep TypeScript project references up to date

Nx automatically updates TypeScript [project references](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/project-references.html) in `tsconfig.json` files to ensure they remain accurate based on your project dependencies (`import` or `require` statements). This sync is automatically done when running tasks such as `build` or `typecheck`, which require updated references to function correctly.

To manually trigger the process to sync the project graph dependencies information to the TypeScript project references, run the following command:

```sh
npx nx sync
```

You can enforce that the TypeScript project references are always in the correct state when running in CI by adding a step to your CI job configuration that runs the following command:

```sh
npx nx sync:check
```

## Install Nx Console

Nx Console is an editor extension that enriches your developer experience. It lets you run tasks, generate code, and improves code autocompletion in your IDE. It is available for VSCode and IntelliJ.

## Node and CDK notes

- This workspace now targets Node 25. Use `nvm use` or the `.nvmrc` file in the repository root to switch.
- CDK CLI telemetry is disabled by default in package scripts by setting `CDK_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1`.
- If you use `lambda-nodejs` helpers, `esbuild` is pinned to `~0.21` to avoid import issues; to use newer esbuild you can add `--packages=bundle` to `bundling.esbuildArgs`.
- CDK CLI versions may diverge from library versions; consult the CDK notices linked in the repo for more details.

Direnv / per-project Node activation

- This repository includes a `.envrc` that loads `nvm` and runs `nvm use` (using `.nvmrc`) when you `cd` into the project. This ensures Node 25 is used for this project only and doesn't change your global Node manager order.
- To enable this behavior on your machine install `direnv` and allow the file:

```bash
brew install direnv
direnv allow .
```

- If you prefer not to use `direnv`, the `.envrc` is safe to inspect and you can run `nvm use` manually in this project.

Note about `asdf` and PATH

- The project's `.envrc` strips `asdf` shims (`$HOME/.asdf/shims` and the common asdf libexec path) from the `PATH` for the direnv session so the `nvm` binary is used inside this repository. This change is local to the direnv-managed shell session and does not alter your global shell configuration.
- To revert this behavior, run `direnv allow` with a modified `.envrc` (or remove the `asdf` filtering lines) and then `direnv reload`.
